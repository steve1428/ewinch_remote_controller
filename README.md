# ewinch_remote_controller
 transmitter and receiver code for remote controlling a paragliding winch
 Based on LILYGOÂ® TTGO ESP32-Paxcounter LoRa32 V2.1 1.6 Version 915MHZ LoRa ESP-32 OLED
 (http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50060&Id=1271&FId=t3:50060:3)
 
 Note the version of the ESP-32 we recieved recently have differnet pin numbers for the OLED than are used in the
 Rx and Tx code from the OP
 look for changes I've made to make it work with the current version of the esp32 (OLED pins 21,22)

 receiver uses PPM for driving the winch and (optinal) UART to read additional information (line length, battery %, dutycycle)
 VESC UART communication depends on https://github.com/SolidGeek/VescUart/

Pin Setup receiver:
PWM_PIN_OUT  13
VESC_RX  14    //connect to TX on Vesc
VESC_TX  2    //connect to RX on Vesc

transmitter buttons connected to GND:
BUTTON_UP  15 
BUTTON_DOWN  12

Line auto stop can be implemented within VESC with vesc_ppm_auto_stop.patch
Default VESC app config is vesc_app_config.xml
